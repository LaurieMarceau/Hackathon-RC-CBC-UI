# mozaik-ui

This project was made during the CBC/Radio-Canada 2019 Hackathon under the theme "Personalisation". We had less than 48 hours to make our idea of a "mozaik" work with the data we were given by CBC and RC.

## Project setup
This project is not in a state to be working. It was made with the Hackathon minding of "just make it work once". It doesn't follow web development standards.
