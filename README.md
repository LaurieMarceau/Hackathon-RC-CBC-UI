# Mozaik UI

This project was made during the CBC/Radio-Canada 2019 Hackathon under the theme "Personalisation". Our team of five had less than 48 hours to make our idea of a "mozaik" work with the data we were given by CBC and RC. The UI was done with Vue.js.

## Project setup
This project is not actually in a state to be working. It was made with the Hackathon minding of "just make it work once in the shortest period of time possible". Web development standards were not followed.

## Results
The homepage once everything was wired together:

The final presentation is available in the results folder.

## Acknowledgement
In our team of five, three were working on the backend (scrapping data, machine learning, recommandations generation, api, etc) and I worked with another teammate on the frontend. It was the first time for me and my teammate that we developped web front-end.
